## Usage

    removecoookie example.com

**Note:** RemoveCookie is pretty dumb. It deletes all cookies with a domain ending in whatever string you provide. So `removecookie example.com` deletes cookies for `example.com` and all subdomains of `example.com` (<i>i.e.</i> `blog.example.com, beta.example.com` and so on). This also means that `removecookie com` will delete *any cookie for all `.com` domains, so be careful (thankfully, not a lot of harm can come from deleting cookies â€” the worst you'll likely experience is losing the contents of a shopping cart or having to log in to a site again).

## Compatibility
I've done virtually no testing. Version 1 has worked for me on most, if not all, versions of Safari from OS X 10.7.5 with Safari 6.0.2 through OS X 10.10. *Version 1.01 is required on OS X 10.11 and later*. It will likely work with 10.6 (and possibly earlier), but you may need to change the build settings in Xcode.
